========================

IMS QTI 2.0 Moodle export format
This plugin allow export of questions using the IMS QTI 2.0 standard.

Written by: Brian King (brian@mediagonal.ch)

Upgraded for: 
- **Moodle 2.9, 3.0** by Jean-Michel Védrine (vedrine@vedrine.net)
- **Moodle 3.11** by Svetozar Stojanovic (svetozar.stojanovic@protonmail.com)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
* Multianswer (cloze) questions are not exported (this was broken in Moodle 1.5 and was not fixed since)
* The Smarty library was removed in Moodle recent versions, so this plugin has to contain a full version of this library. Smarty version 2 is still used to save me (Jean-Michel Védrine) the hassle to upgrade the code and templates to Smarty 3.

Note: This was done because I had a need for it and I share it just in case it could be usefull as it is but don't rely on a long term support.
